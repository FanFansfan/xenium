  /**
   * @brief A small helper class for correctly aligned dynamic allocations of
   * over-aligned types.
   *
   * Dynamic allocation using the standard `operator new` does not consider the
   * alignment of the allocated type. To ensure that dynamic allocations are
   * correctly aligned, classes can inherit from `aligned_object`.
   * If not specified explicitly, `aligned_object` implicitly uses the alignment
   * from `std::alignment_of<Derived>()`.
   * @tparam Derived
   * @tparam Alignment the alignment to use for dynamic allocations.
   * If this value is 0, the alignment is derived from `Derived`. Defaults to 0.
